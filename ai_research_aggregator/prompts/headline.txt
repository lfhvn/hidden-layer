Write a compelling newsletter subject line for today's Hidden Layer briefing. This appears in the inbox and needs to make an AI practitioner open the email instead of archiving it.

## Today's top 3 items
{top_items}

## Date
{date}

Rules:
- Max 70 characters (including "Hidden Layer: " prefix which you should NOT include — it's added automatically)
- Lead with the most interesting thing, not a generic summary
- Be specific. "New interpretability results" is boring. "SAEs can now find the lying circuit" is not.
- Slightly provocative is fine. Clickbait is not. Your reader is too smart for that and will unsubscribe.
- No emoji. No ALL CAPS. No exclamation marks.

Return ONLY the subject line text, nothing else.
