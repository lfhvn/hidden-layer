   "source": "# Custom Strategies Benchmark\n\n**Focus:** Compare adaptive multi-agent strategies against single-model baseline\n\n**Date:** [Fill in]  \n**Author:** Leif Haven Martinson  \n\n## Purpose\n\nThis notebook focuses on benchmarking custom mental model strategies:\n- **Single Model** - Baseline performance\n- **Design Critique** - 5 designer archetypes provide iterative feedback\n- **Interdisciplinary Team** - PM, Engineer, Designer collaborate  \n- **Adaptive Team** - ⭐ **NEW!** Dynamically generates custom experts tailored to each specific problem\n\nCompare these approaches on established benchmarks with **latest 2025 SOTA baselines**.\n\n## Adaptive Team Strategy\n\nThe **adaptive_team** strategy is a meta-strategy that:\n1. Analyzes each problem to understand what expertise is needed\n2. Dynamically generates custom expert personas specifically for that problem\n3. Runs collaborative analysis with the problem-specific experts\n\n**Example:** \n- Math problem → Mathematician, Math Teacher, Applied Scientist\n- Business question → Market Analyst, CFO, Operations Manager\n- Medical question → Doctor, Pharmacist, Research Scientist\n\nThis allows the expert team to be **perfectly tailored** to each individual problem!"
