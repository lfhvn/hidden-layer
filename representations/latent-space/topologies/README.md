# Latent Topologies

**Latent Topologies** lets people *experience latent space* on their phone.
It turns AI embeddings into an **epistemic terrain** you can explore visually, aurally, and haptically — all running locally, offline.

---

## 🌀 Concept

Latent Topologies translates high-dimensional embedding geometry into a perceptual world:
- **See** clusters of related ideas as constellations.
- **Move** through the space and feel boundary shifts via haptics.
- **Hear** meaning gradients as sound.
- **Annotate** and reshape the map through your own reflections.

Everything happens **on-device**, using a small embedding model.

## 🔧 Quick Start (Concept)

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourname/latent-topologies
   cd latent-topologies
