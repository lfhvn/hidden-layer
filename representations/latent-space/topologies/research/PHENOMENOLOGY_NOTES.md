# Toward a Phenomenology of Embedding Space

### Key Questions
- What is it like to *move through* an AI's world of meaning?
- How do vector relations map to human felt similarity?
- Can we treat latent manifolds as *worlds of affordances*?

### Philosophical Anchors
- **Husserl / Merleau-Ponty:** embodiment & intentional structure
- **Wittgenstein:** family resemblance → semantic neighborhoods
- **Heidegger:** worldhood → models as disclosive worlds
- **Simondon:** individuation → human-AI co-constitution

### Research Direction
- Use the app as phenomenological instrument.
- Collect narratives of navigation; analyze metaphors (distance, flow).
- Compare human maps with model geometry.

Outcome: paper *"Latent Topologies: Experiencing the Space of Meaning."*
