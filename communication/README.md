# Communication Research Area

**Research Focus**: How do multiple AI agents communicate and coordinate to solve problems more effectively than single agents?

---

## Projects

### multi-agent/
Multi-agent coordination strategies including debate, CRIT, consensus, and XFN teams.

**Key Questions**:
- When and why do multi-agent systems outperform single agents?
- What coordination mechanisms emerge from multi-agent interaction?
- How do different strategies compare on various task types?

**See**: `multi-agent/README.md` for details

### ai-to-ai-comm/
Non-linguistic communication via latent representations - exploring whether LLMs can communicate more efficiently through internal states than through natural language.

**Key Questions**:
- Can agents communicate via latent space coordinates?
- What are the efficiency vs. quality tradeoffs?
- How do agents develop shared representations?

**See**: `ai-to-ai-comm/README.md` for details

## Cross-Area Connections

### With Representations
Can agents leverage latent space coordinates for communication instead of natural language tokens?

### With Theory of Mind
Do agents develop models of each other during multi-agent interactions? How does ToM enable better coordination?

### With Alignment
How can we ensure multi-agent systems remain aligned when coordinating? What emergent behaviors arise?
