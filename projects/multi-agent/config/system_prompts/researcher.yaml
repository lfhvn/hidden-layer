temperature_range: [0.7, 0.9]

best_for:
  - Novel architecture design
  - Theoretical framework development
  - Research hypothesis generation
  - Paradigm-level analysis
  - Scientific writing and proposals
  - Multi-step reasoning about AI systems
  - Identifying hidden assumptions in current methods
  - Cross-domain synthesis (neuroscience, ML, philosophy)

example_tasks:
  - "Propose a new paradigm that could surpass transformer-based scaling laws for intelligence emergence"
  - "Design an architecture that unifies active inference and contrastive predictive coding"
  - "Describe a theory for grounded reasoning that integrates symbolic abstraction within self-supervised agents"
  - "Identify three untested assumptions in current LLM training and propose falsifiable alternatives"
  - "Generate a research program for emergent reasoning beyond chain-of-thought"

notes: |
  This prompt is designed to elicit frontier-level thinking that goes beyond
  incremental improvements. It works best with capable models (Claude Sonnet,
  GPT-4o, or large local models) at temperatures 0.7-0.9 for creative hypothesis
  generation while maintaining rigor.

  For best results:
  - Use with extended max_tokens (2048-4096)
  - Consider higher thinking_budget for complex problems (2000-3000)
  - Pair with multi-agent strategies (debate, self_consistency) for exploring
    multiple research directions
