# AI-to-AI Communication

**Status**: Early Research

Non-linguistic communication between LLMs via latent representations.

## Research Question

Can LLMs communicate more efficiently through latent representations instead of natural language?

## Approaches (To Be Implemented)

1. **Latent Vector Messaging**: Share activation vectors
2. **Concept Vector Communication**: Use shared concept libraries
3. **Embedding Coordinates**: Direct coordinate sharing

## Research Questions

- Is latent communication faster/cheaper than natural language?
- Can it convey more information?
- What protocols emerge?
- Does it work across different models?

## Next Steps

1. Literature review
2. Proof-of-concept implementation
3. Benchmark against natural language
4. Integration with multi-agent systems
